# School_District_Analysis
Module 4

## Overview of the school district analysis:
The school district discovered academic dishonestly among the 9th grade population at Thomas High School. Maria and her supervisor has instructed us to do another analysis of the data. We will be applying NaN (Not a Number) to all 461 student records for the 9th graders at Thomas High school, and analysing our updated results for any significant changes. 

## Cleaning up the 9th grade Data. Set all 9th graders @ Thomas High school to Not a Number

Secondary Analysis: Based off our secondary analysis (Removing the 9th grade NaN from Thomas High School) we can see a decline of 1.1% in passing math and 1.3%        decline in passing reading. Based off this, We can see that removing the 9th grade data, does not affect the school districts very much.
